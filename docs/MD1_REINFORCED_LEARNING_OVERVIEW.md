# 🧠 MD1: REINFORCED LEARNING OVERVIEW
## Intelligent Coaching System for 200-PDF Journey to Golden State

### 🎯 **VISION: AUTONOMOUS EXCELLENCE**

After processing 200 coached PDFs, the system will have evolved to near-perfect extraction with minimal human intervention. Each agent and the sectionizer will have learned from every success and failure, building a knowledge base that makes future extractions increasingly accurate.

## 📊 **THE FOUR LEARNING PHASES**

### **Phase 1: EXPLORATION (PDFs 1-50)**
**Goal**: Discover what works across diverse document types

#### Characteristics:
- **Aggressive Coaching**: 5 rounds maximum per agent
- **Broad Experimentation**: Try multiple prompt strategies
- **Pattern Discovery**: Identify document type clusters
- **Baseline Building**: Establish initial performance metrics

#### Key Metrics:
- Initial accuracy: 60-70% expected
- Target by PDF 50: 75-80% accuracy
- Coaching rounds: Average 3-4 per document
- Unique patterns discovered: 50-100

#### Learning Strategy:
```python
if accuracy < 0.70:
    strategy = "major_restructuring"  # Complete prompt overhaul
elif accuracy < 0.80:
    strategy = "targeted_improvement"  # Focus on failure points
else:
    strategy = "refinement"  # Small adjustments only
```

### **Phase 2: OPTIMIZATION (PDFs 51-150)**
**Goal**: Refine successful patterns, eliminate failures

#### Characteristics:
- **Selective Coaching**: 3 rounds maximum
- **Pattern Consolidation**: Group similar documents
- **Golden Example Building**: Save best extractions
- **Cross-Agent Learning**: Share insights between agents

#### Key Metrics:
- Entry accuracy: 75-80%
- Target by PDF 150: 85-90% accuracy
- Coaching rounds: Average 1-2 per document
- Golden examples collected: 30-50 per agent

#### Learning Strategy:
```python
# Selective coaching based on confidence
if confidence < 0.75:
    coach_aggressively()
elif specific_field_missing():
    coach_targeted_field()
else:
    skip_coaching()  # Already good enough
```

### **Phase 3: CONVERGENCE (PDFs 151-200)**
**Goal**: Lock in golden prompts, validate consistency

#### Characteristics:
- **Minimal Coaching**: 2 rounds maximum
- **Consistency Testing**: Ensure stable performance
- **Edge Case Handling**: Focus on outliers
- **Prompt Finalization**: Prepare production templates

#### Key Metrics:
- Entry accuracy: 85-90%
- Target by PDF 200: 95%+ accuracy
- Coaching rounds: Average 0-1 per document
- Prompt stability: <5% change between versions

### **Phase 4: GOLDEN STATE (PDFs 201+)**
**Goal**: Production-ready autonomous extraction

#### Characteristics:
- **Self-Sufficient**: Coaching only for anomalies
- **Auto-Enhancement**: System adds examples automatically
- **Quality Guarantee**: 95%+ accuracy maintained
- **Continuous Learning**: Passive improvement from usage

## 🔄 **REINFORCED LEARNING ALGORITHM**

### **Core Concept: Memory-Enhanced Coaching**

The system remembers not just the current extraction, but the entire history of what worked and what didn't for similar documents.

```python
class ReinforcedLearningOrchestrator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.performance_memory = PerformanceMemoryBank()
        self.prompt_evolution = PromptEvolutionTracker()
        self.golden_examples = GoldenExampleLibrary()
        self.pattern_recognition = PatternRecognitionEngine()
    
    def coach_with_reinforcement(self, current_extraction, doc_metadata):
        # 1. Classify document type
        doc_type = self.pattern_recognition.classify(doc_metadata)
        
        # 2. Retrieve best historical performance
        best_historical = self.performance_memory.get_best(
            agent_id=current_extraction.agent_id,
            doc_type=doc_type
        )
        
        # 3. Compare and decide strategy
        if current_extraction.accuracy < best_historical.accuracy - 0.10:
            # Major regression - revert to what worked
            return self.revert_to_best_known(best_historical)
        elif current_extraction.accuracy < 0.95:
            # Room for improvement
            return self.incremental_coaching(current_extraction, best_historical)
        else:
            # Near perfect - save as golden
            return self.save_as_golden_example(current_extraction)
```

## 🎯 **KEY INNOVATIONS**

### **1. Temporal Performance Tracking**
Every coaching round is tracked with temporal context:
- What worked in round 2 vs round 4?
- Did we get worse after coaching?
- Should we revert to an earlier version?

### **2. Cross-Document Learning**
Insights from one document improve others:
- Supplier patterns found in Göteborg BRF help Stockholm BRF
- Financial table structures recognized across regions
- Board member formats standardized

### **3. Agent Specialization Evolution**
Each agent develops its own expertise:
- Balance sheet agent learns Swedish accounting formats
- Governance agent masters board member variations
- Suppliers agent builds comprehensive vendor dictionary

### **4. Gemini as Meta-Coach**
Gemini 2.5 Pro sees the full picture:
```python
gemini_context = {
    "current_run": current_extraction,
    "best_ever": historical_best,
    "recent_5_runs": last_five_attempts,
    "golden_examples": validated_examples,
    "pdf_progress": f"{pdf_count}/200",
    "learning_phase": current_phase,
    "prompt_evolution": prompt_history
}
```
